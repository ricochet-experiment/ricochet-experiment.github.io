The coherent elastic scattering of neutrinos is an interaction predicted a long time ago, but only recently observed. It is a neutral current interaction, and its accurate measurement will allow to observe or not any deviation from the standard model.
This is the objective of the Ricochet project, thanks to intense R&D on cryogenic detection technology, which should lead to a spectacular improvement in the performance of the latter. The experiment will contain 27 bolometers in Germanium or Zinc for a total mass of the order of a kilogram. These detectors will be capable of rejecting background noise and will be installed in a cryostat near the ILL experimental reactor to obtain a large flow of electron antineutrinos.
